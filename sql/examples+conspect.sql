    /* 
    The SELECT clause that begins each SELECT statement specifies the data items to be retrieved by the query. 
The items are usually specified by a select list, a list of select items separated by commas. 
Each select item in the list generates a single column of query results, in left-to-right order. 
A select item can be one of the following:
- A column name, identifying a column from the table(s) named in the FROM clause. 
When a column name appears as a select item, SQL simply takes the value of that column from 
each row of the database table and places it in the corresponding row of query results.
- A constant, specifying that the same constant value is to appear in every row of the query results.
- A SQL expression, indicating that SQL must calculate the value to be placed into the query results, 
as specified by the expression.
