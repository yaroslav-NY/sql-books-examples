    /* 
    The SELECT clause that begins each SELECT statement specifies the data items to be retrieved by the query. 
The items are usually specified by a select list, a list of select items separated by commas. 
Each select item in the list generates a single column of query results, in left-to-right order. 
A select item can be one of the following:
- A column name, identifying a column from the table(s) named in the FROM clause. 
When a column name appears as a select item, SQL simply takes the value of that column from 
each row of the database table and places it in the corresponding row of query results.
- A constant, specifying that the same constant value is to appear in every row of the query results.
- A SQL expression, indicating that SQL must calculate the value to be placed into the query results, 
as specified by the expression.

     The HAVING clause is used to include or exclude row groups from the query results, so the
     search condition it specifies must be one that applies to the group as a whole rather than to
     individual rows. This means that an item appearing within the search condition in a
     HAVING clause can be:
     • A constant
     • A column function, which produces a single value summarizing the rows in the group
     • A grouping column, which by definition has the same value in every row of the group
     • An expression involving combinations of these
